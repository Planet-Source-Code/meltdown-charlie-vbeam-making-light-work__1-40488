### Description

This is the second incarnation of Blade Pro Wannabe, being the ongoing quest to create a useful open source project in VB for creating some of the neat 2d lighting effects seen in such programs as Photoshop (lighting tool), Corel's Paint program and graphics plugin utilities like Flaming Pear's Super Blade Pro.

- adjustable lighting colors for abmient, diffuse and specualar elements of light.

- adjust the ammount of glare or shine.
